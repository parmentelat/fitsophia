# The R2Lab testbed

The R2Lab testbed, located at Inria Sophia Antipolis, and dedicated to **reproducible** wireless experiments, will be open to public usage starting January 2016.

This testbed offers an acheoid chamber with 37 nodes deployed in a 90m2 room; it has been developped as part of the French FIT Equipex Project with funding from A.N.R., and is part of the OneLab federation of testbeds, that manages registration and resource reservation.

Usage is open to anyone, but requires free registration at the OneLab portal.

Our usage model is that the whole testbed is reserved as a single resource, so that only one experiment can access the testbed at any one time, and so be in full control of its electromagnetic environment.

Also we offer bare metal, with a few predefined images available, so that users can run any O.S. and software they need to. Available hardware includes WiFi, USRP and OpenAirInterface.

All technical details, including node specifications, live status, and tutorials, can be found [at the testbed's website http://r2lab.inria.fr/](http://r2lab.inria.fr/); which actually is a django app based on the `r2lab.inria.fr` subdirectory right here.
