# Entry point

[Enter the official OneLab portal at http://portal.onelab.eu](http://portal.onelab.eu)

Note there is also a [development portal](http://dev.myslice.info) that is also connected to R2Lab, but usage should be restricted in theory

# Registration

Click [the *Sign up* button](http://dev.myslice.info/register) 

In the Organization Tab, Select ***INRIA - INRIA OneLab***

and enter requested info.

As far as keys, it is probably best to select the default policy which for the portal to generate a keypair for you.

Confirm the request; I should receive an e-mail, but it won't hurt if you send one to me directly as well so I can vouch for you and activate the request.

# Project and slices
For the sake of simplicity I have created a single project for now, that is named `onelab.inria.r2lab`	

From the dashboard in the portal you can [Create a slice](https://portal.onelab.eu/portal/slice_request/), please use this `onelab.inria.r2lab` project as a placeholder for you slice.

Here again I suspect I will need to approve the slice creation request.

Once this is done, you can see the slice in the dashboard, click on it and obtain the resource browser for attaching and reserving nodes.
