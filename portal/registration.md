# Entry point
The official OneLab portal is located at [http://portal.onelab.eu](http://portal.onelab.eu).

Note there is also a [development portal](http://dev.myslice.info) that is also connected to R2Lab, but usage should be restricted in theory.

# Registration
To proceed your registration ate onelab portal:

**1)** Fill the form with the requested info. Organization, first name, etc ... . If your organization is not listed in the portal, you can [request](https://portal.onelab.eu/portal/join) its addition.

In the keys form, you'll find two options:

**Default/Automatic:** Choose this option if you have no keys generated in your device or if you are not an advanced user. In case of any doubts about the keys process, this option is recommended as well.

# Your experiments
In order to use the plataform, run and play your experiments, you must **create a new project** or **join a project** that already exists and book an **slice** inside of it. These concepts and how to interact with them are explained as follows.

### Project:
A **project** is a sub-authority under the responsibility of your institution gathering users who will be able to create slices for their experiments.
Once logged in your dashboard a **[create/join project](https://portal.onelab.eu/portal/project_request/)**  project link is proposed and you can:

- **create new project** tab:  
In this option some informations for your new project are required.
Once this information is given the project could be submited.

- **Join a project** tab:
In this option a list of projects already created are proposed. Select the project you would like to join and confirm. 

An email confirmation resumes your action and your request will be send to authority manager validation.

### Slices
A **slice** is a set of testbed resources on which you can conduct an experiment. You can request a new slice or either ask your colleagues to give you access to an existing one.

- **Create a slice**:
Once logged, in your dashboard a **[request slice](https://portal.onelab.eu/portal/slice_request/)** link is proposed. 
Once this information is given the slice could be required.

When a slice request is created, a confirmation email resumes your action and your request will be send to authority manager validation.
