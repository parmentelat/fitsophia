# Entry point
Enter the official OneLab portal at [http://portal.onelab.eu](http://portal.onelab.eu)

> Note there is also a [development portal](http://dev.myslice.info) that is also connected to R2Lab, but usage should be restricted in theory

# Registration

- Click the **[Sign up](http://dev.myslice.info/register)** button 
- In the Organization tab, select: **INRIA - INRIA OneLab**
- Fill the form with the requested info (*name, surname, password, etc*). However, as far as keys, you'll have two options:
 - (Advanced) I know what means and I aready have a key generated, then:
> Click in select file button, search at your computer your correspondent key and add to the form.<br>
Once chosen the manual delegation of credentials option, a **[complementary step](https://portal.onelab.eu/portal/manual_delegation)** is required and can be done after the validation of your account by the manager of your organization.

 - (Default and recommended) I have no keys or I am not an advanced user or I have doubts what means, then:
> With this policy choice the portal will generate and manage the keypair identity for you.

- Finally, confirm the form in the button **sign up**

- You should receive a message like this:<br>
> **Sign up information received**.
<br>You can now log in to the portal. You will have limited access.
To gain full access, two steps are required:
<br> **1.** You confirm your signup request by clicking on the link in the email that we have sent to your email address.
Please be aware that it can happen that this email was automatically filtered to your spam box. 
<br>
Please check your spam box if you do not receive the email in a few minutes
<br>
<br>**2.** A manager from your organization validates your request. Upon confirmation of your signup request,
we will send an email to the managers at your organization with a validation request.
of the confirmation will I should receive an e-mail, but it won't hurt if you send one to me directly as well so I can vouch for you and activate the request.

# Project and slices
For the sake of simplicity we have created a single project for now, that is named: `onelab.inria.r2lab`	

From the dashboard in the portal you can [create a slice](https://portal.onelab.eu/portal/slice_request/), please use this: `onelab.inria.r2lab` project as a placeholder for you slice.

Once this is done, you can see the slice in the dashboard, click on it and obtain the resource browser for attaching and reserving nodes.
