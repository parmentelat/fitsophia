# Entry point

<br>You can now log in to the portal. You will have limited access.
To gain full access, two steps are required:
<br> **1.** You confirm your signup request by clicking on the link in the email that we have sent to your email address.
Please be aware that it can happen that this email was automatically filtered to your spam box. 
<br>
Please check your spam box if you do not receive the email in a few minutes
<br>
**2.** A manager from your organization validates your request. Upon confirmation of your signup request,
we will send an email to the managers at your organization with a validation request.
of the confirmation will I should receive an e-mail, but it won't hurt if you send one to me directly as well so I can vouch for you and activate the request.

# Your experiments
In order to use the plataform and play your experiments, two ways are proposed. The first one concerns **create a project**, the second one concerns in **join a project** that already exists.

# Project
A **project** is a sub-authority under the responsability of your institution gathering users, who will be able to create slices for their experiments.

- **[Crete a project]**
  
 > Once logged, in your dashboard a **[create/join project](https://portal.onelab.eu/portal/project_request/)** link is proposed. 
Using the link, three fields are requested: project name, authority and a description of the purpose.
<br>
When a project request is created, a confirmation email resumes your action and your request will be send to authority manager validation.

- **[Join a project]**
> In this option, a list of projects already created are proposed. Just select the project you would like to join and confirm. 
<br>
When a project join is made, a confirmation email resumes your action and your request will be send to authority manager validation.

- **[Join INRIA's project]**
> For the sake of simplicity we have created a single project for now, that is named: `onelab.inria.r2lab`	

# Slices
A **slice** is a set of testbed resources on which you can conduct an experiment. 
Either ask your colleagues to give you access to an existing slice or request a new one.

- **[Crete a slice]**
> Once logged, in your dashboard a **[request slice](https://portal.onelab.eu/portal/slice_request/)** link is proposed. 
Using the link, four fields are requested: slice name, project name - under which you want your slice, an URL for the experiment and a single description of the purpose.
<br>
When a slice request is created, a confirmation email resumes your action and your request will be send to authority manager validation.

- **[INRIA's slice]**
 > From the fields required in the **[slice request](https://portal.onelab.eu/portal/slice_request/)**, please use this name `onelab.inria.r2lab` project as a placeholder for you slice.

Once the slice request action is done and activated by the manager, you can see the slice in the dashboard, click on it and obtain the resource browser for attaching and reserving nodes.
