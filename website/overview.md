<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6">  
  R2Lab is a Wi-fi mesh testbed infrastructure suitable for testing wireless devices and heterogeneous wireless communication.
  <br>
  <br>
	R2Lab, as part of a federation of independent experimental testbeds, provides a diverse and higher-performance platform for advanced Wi-fi experiments. The project priorizes scale and realism for supporting future wireless research.
	<br>
	<br>
	Through R2Lab testbed, located at INRIA Institute in Sophia-Antipolis - France, we offer a infrastructure with thirty-seven wireless nodes, offering highly flexible experimentation in a array of wireless network, allowing experimenters test in many ways the optimizations in radio frequencies for wireless applications.
	<br>
	<br>
	R2Lab as part of a Europe testbed project is partner of [OneLAb](http://www.onelab.eu/) based at UPMC in Paris and [PlanetLab Europe](http://www.planet-lab.eu/) federation which has servers connected to the core internet.
