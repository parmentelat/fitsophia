| `u14.48-oai-gw.ndz.OK` | `u14.319-oai-enb.ndz.OK` | kind of OK |
| | | before Rohit |
| | | very uncompliant with his instructions |
| | | it's not 3.19-lowlat but 4.2-generic in fact | 
| | | it has UHD from ETTUS and not from oai |
| | | CPU tweaks are not implemented |
| `u14.48-oai-gw.ndz.OK` | `u14.319-oai-enb-rohit`  | I think I've seen |
| | | the node subscribing fine |
| | | the uplink working fine |
| | | the downlink being dumb |
| `u14.48-oai-gw.ndz.OK` | `u14.319-oai-enb-uhdoai`  | needs to be rebuilt |
| `u14.48-oai-gw.ndz.OK` | `u14.319-oai-enb-uhdettus`  | worth a try |
