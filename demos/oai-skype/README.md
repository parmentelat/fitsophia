# OpenAirInterface demo

The script `oai-scenario.py` here can be used to run a simple experiment in R2lab, that

* deploys an LTE network
  * using 2 regular nodes for running a HSS and an EPC
  * and one USRP-enabled node for running a e-nodeB (base station)

* associates the Nexus phone in this cell
