# Purpose

This repository contains the code designed to be used in operations on the various pieces of the R2lab testbed, typically nodes, user environment on the gateway or for building images, as well as on macphones, and other similar devices.

# History

This contents used to be part of a wider repo at
https://github.com/parmentelat/r2lab/infra

But that one became way too large over time, and it bacame apparent that a split was required, if only so that updates could run more efficiently

# Legacy

We are not going to be able to update all the r2lab images to reflect this change, at least not overnight.

For that reason, the big `r2lab` repo still contains an `infra` subdirectory that is a ***git subtree*** towards here
